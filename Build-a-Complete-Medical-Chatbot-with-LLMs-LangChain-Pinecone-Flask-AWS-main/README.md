Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a medical chatbot, built with modern Generative AI techniques. Youâ€™ll see how I leveraged large language models, vector search, and a web backend to create an interactive application that handles medical-domain queries.


 Key Features

Natural-language chat interface for medical queries

Uses LangChain to structure prompts, chains and retrieval logic

Employs Pinecone vector-database to store and search medical knowledge embeddings

Built on the Flask web framework for backend/API and served as a web app

Modular, clean code structure with configuration, prompts, data, UI all separated


 Technologies Used

Python 

LangChain

Pinecone

Flask

OpenAI GPT-based model (or whichever LLM you used)

HTML/CSS frontend (or any UI you built)

Git & GitHub for version control

 AWS services: EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, etc
